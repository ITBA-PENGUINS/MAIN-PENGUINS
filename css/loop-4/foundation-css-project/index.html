It was designed in 1972 and production of many variants in different calibers continues to the present day. It is most famous for replacing the M1911 .45 ACP pistol as the standard sidearms of the United States armed forces in 1985 as the M9 pistol.

                        <p>In production from 1850 until 1873, the Colt Navy Revolver changed warfare and the world.
                             Much lighter than the Colt Dragoon of 1847 and originally designated the “Ranger,”
                              the Colt Navy was adored by cavalry soldiers, partisan ruffians, and gunslingers like 
                              Jesse James and Wild Bill Hickock. The revolver remained popular long after the introduction
                               of the modern self-contained cartridge. The Colt Navy is a legendary sidearm and could be 
                               considered the first true fighting handgun.

                               of Roosevelt’s Rough Riders and won the West in the hands of men like Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson.
                                General George Patton also carried an 1873 Colt Single Action Army, which should be all the endorsement
                                 a pistol needs to achieve fabled status. Known as the Peacemaker, the gun would’ve cost you about $17
                                  in the 1870s. Today, you’ll pay 100 times that for a current production 1873 and as much as 500 times
                                the original price for a first-generation specimen in good condition.

                          <p>Created by John Browning - arguably the greatest firearm designer of all time - this pistol served the American military
                               from 1911 until 1990 and is still in the holsters of some soldiers today. The Colt 1911 helped win two World Wars
                                and may be the most copied handgun ever. Lt. Col. Jeff Cooper referred to it as the “Yankee Fist,” and today,
                                 the 1911 is more popular than ever before. It dominates the custom handgun market and is offered in multiple
                                 configurations by many manufacturers.

                             Now in its fifth generation, the Glock 17 has become one of the most recognized pistols in the world, and today
                              a Glock, in some form or another, likely fills the holsters of more policemen than any other handgun.
                               Essentially the design is nothing more than a modification of the 1935 Browning Hi-Power, and the 17,
                                like all Glocks, has a fine reputation for reliability and durability. Because of their performance
                                 for the price, Glocks are one of the widest distributed handguns in the world.

                              handgun that has a six-round capacity. It is similar in size to the Glock 42; however, as fires larger round.
                               Even though it was released relatively recently, it has become popular among people who concealed carry.
                                It is a flat, semi-automatic pistol that provides the reliability of a Glock in a small package.

                            ("Universale Selbstladepistole" or "Universal Self-Loading Pistol")
                            is the .45 ACP version of the USP. The USP .45 is based on the Mark 23
                            handgun in service with some USSOCOM personnel.
                            Design work on a new family of pistols commenced in
                            September 1989 focused primarily on the U.S.
                            commercial and law enforcement markets. In 1991,
                            USP prototypes participated in rigorous testing alongside H&K's entry
                            in the OHWS (Offensive Handgun Weapon System) program requested by
                            the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and which would later result
                            in the Mk 23 Mod 0. The USP prototypes were then refined in 1992,
                            based on input from the OHWS trials and the design was finalized in December of the same year.
                            The USP was formally introduced in January 1993with the USP40 model
                            (the base version) chambered for the increasingly popular .40 S&W cartridge,
                            followed soon by the USP9 (using the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge), and in May 1995—the USP45
                            (caliber .45 ACP).

                            a polymer-framed semi-automatic striker-fired handgun.
                            The VP designation in the name refers to Volkspistole,
                            which translates to "people's pistol", while SFP stands for
                            "striker-fired pistol". The 9 stands for the caliber designation
                            of 9 mm. The VP9 is the third striker-fired pistol that HK has
                            produced. A variant of the VP9, the VP40, is chambered for .40 S&W

                        <p>Also known as the Military & Police or Victory Model, this fixed-sight, 
                            double-action revolver has been offered with barrel lengths ranging from
                             2 to 6 inches, and it is estimated that more than six million Model 10s
                              have been manufactured. The revolver saw service in both World Wars and
                               was chambered in .38 Long Colt, .38 S&W, and .38 Special. Thousands
                                of policemen have walked their beats with a Model 10 at their sides.
                                 In 1974, S&W introduced a heavy-barrel version chambered for
                                  the .357 Magnum known as the Model 13.

                          <p>You would never think that a high-quality, double-action revolver (with a six-inch barrel
                               and Circassian walnut grips) chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, could have been
                               a success-especially considering that it was introduced during the depression.
                                But between 1931 and 1939, Smith & Wesson sold more than 17,000 K22s. With a crisp,
                                 single-action trigger pull and a guarantee to shoot within 1.5 inches at 50 yards,
                                  this gun became an instant classic and was the forerunner to a long line of .22 rimfire
                                   revolvers from Smith & Wesson.

                          <p>This pistol has the distinction of being the first U.S. designed/manufactured double-action,
                               semi-automatic pistol marketed in the United States. The Model 39 was chambered for 9mm Luger
                                and was designed by S&W at the request of the Army to be an American equivalent to the Walther P38.
                                 The de-cocker and 8-round, single-stack magazine were like those on the P38, but it had a
                                  locking mechanism similar to the Browning Hi-Power. The Model 39′s true contribution was
                                   that after adoption by the Illinois State Police in 1967, it set the stage for a switch
                                    to semi-automatic handguns by American law enforcement. It also served as the forerunner
                                     to the higher-capacity Model 59—and many aluminum- and steel-framed S&W pistols—that so
                                      many police agencies would fall in love with.
