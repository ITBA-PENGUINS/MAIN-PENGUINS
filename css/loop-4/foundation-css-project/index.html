                        <p>In production from 1850 until 1873, the Colt Navy Revolver changed warfare and the world.
                             Much lighter than the Colt Dragoon of 1847 and originally designated the “Ranger,”
                              the Colt Navy was adored by cavalry soldiers, partisan ruffians, and gunslingers like 
                              Jesse James and Wild Bill Hickock. The revolver remained popular long after the introduction
                               of the modern self-contained cartridge. The Colt Navy is a legendary sidearm and could be 
                               considered the first true fighting handgun.

                          <p>Likely the most iconic handgun in existence, the Colt Single Action Army gained fame in the holsters
                               of Roosevelt’s Rough Riders and won the West in the hands of men like Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson.
                                General George Patton also carried an 1873 Colt Single Action Army, which should be all the endorsement
                                 a pistol needs to achieve fabled status. Known as the Peacemaker, the gun would’ve cost you about $17
                                  in the 1870s. Today, you’ll pay 100 times that for a current production 1873 and as much as 500 times
                                the original price for a first-generation specimen in good condition.

                          <p>Created by John Browning - arguably the greatest firearm designer of all time - this pistol served the American military
                               from 1911 until 1990 and is still in the holsters of some soldiers today. The Colt 1911 helped win two World Wars
                                and may be the most copied handgun ever. Lt. Col. Jeff Cooper referred to it as the “Yankee Fist,” and today,
                                 the 1911 is more popular than ever before. It dominates the custom handgun market and is offered in multiple
                                 configurations by many manufacturers.

                        <p>The Glock 17 was the first of an extensive line of polymer handguns to be offered by the Austrian manufacturer.
                             Now in its fifth generation, the Glock 17 has become one of the most recognized pistols in the world, and today
                              a Glock, in some form or another, likely fills the holsters of more policemen than any other handgun.
                               Essentially the design is nothing more than a modification of the 1935 Browning Hi-Power, and the 17,
                                like all Glocks, has a fine reputation for reliability and durability. Because of their performance
                                 for the price, Glocks are one of the widest distributed handguns in the world.

                          <p>The Glock 43 is arguably the most popular pistol in the world. The Glock 43 is a single stack, compact 9 mm 
                              handgun that has a six-round capacity. It is similar in size to the Glock 42; however, as fires larger round.
                               Even though it was released relatively recently, it has become popular among people who concealed carry.
                                It is a flat, semi-automatic pistol that provides the reliability of a Glock in a small package.
